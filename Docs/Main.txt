==Donations
Ackis has setup a donation site via [[http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462|Pledgie]].  Feel free to donate if you like this AddOn - we have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped us.  We did not write this AddOn with the intent to make any money from it.  It was written help us (and others) with some needs that we saw in-game, and with our goal to make it filled with information it's become a massive project.

==Commands
*Item Query
**<<code>>/iq<</code>>

**<<code>>/sq<</code>>
*Reset the lock out time
**<<code>>/iqr<</code>>
*Scan Item ID ranges
**<<code>>/is<</code>>
*Scan Spell ID ranges
**<<code>>/ss<</code>>
*Load all "safe" items into cache.  This will attempt to query all the known items which are safe (aka appear on standard vendors, crafted by items made standard by tradeskills, etc).  This is highly unstable at this moment in time.
**<<code>>/safequery<</code>>
